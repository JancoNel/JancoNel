## My Journey as a Programmer

Starting out, I learned the basics with **batch scripts** and **Lua** in 8th grade â€” simple but powerful for automating and scripting tasks. It was an exciting time where I felt like a true hacker, getting things to work with just a few lines of code.

Then came **Delphi**, a stage in my life that was a bit like school â€” I had to deal with its quirks and limitations. It wasnâ€™t my favorite, but it gave me structure and some insights into Object Pascal, which would later be helpful.

As I grew more interested in security, I ventured into **Python** â€” a language that opened up a whole new world of flexibility and efficiency. Python quickly became my go-to language for scripting, hacking tools, and even some personal projects. I started feeling the true power of programming as I dived deeper into more advanced topics like web scraping, automation, and cybersecurity.

But I didnâ€™t stop there. The next big step was **C++**, where I really learned how to manage memory, optimize performance, and build more complex applications. While it can be tough and low-level, C++ gave me a deeper understanding of how systems work. Iâ€™m still working with it and pushing myself to learn more, especially in areas like systems programming, reverse engineering, and malware analysis.

Along the way, **JavaScript** served as my hobby language â€” I used it to dabble in web development and various personal projects. It was like a high school side project, helping me learn the basics of front-end development and web interactions.

Now, as I look back, I realize that each stage of my journey, whether batch scripts, Lua, Delphi, Python, C++, or JavaScript, helped me grow as a programmer and as someone interested in the depths of cybersecurity. Each language taught me new skills and gave me different perspectives on how to solve problems. And the best part is that Iâ€™m still learning, still coding, and still hacking away.

Itâ€™s a crazy ride, but every language and every project helped shape who I am today as a developer.
